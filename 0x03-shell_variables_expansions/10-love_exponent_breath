#!/bin/bash
echo $((BREATH ** LOVE))
Explanation:
First line: #!/bin/bash - Shebang specifying Bash interpreter

Second line: echo $((BREATH ** LOVE)) - Uses arithmetic expansion with exponentiation operator

How it works:
In arithmetic expansion $(()), the ** operator performs exponentiation

BREATH ** LOVE calculates 4 to the power of 3

The expression 4 ** 3 evaluates to 64 (4 × 4 × 4)

echo prints the result followed by a newline

Demonstration:
julien@production-503e7013:~/$ export BREATH=4
julien@production-503e7013:~/$ export LOVE=3
julien@production-503e7013:~/$ ./10-love_exponent_breath
64
Calculation:
4³ = 4 × 4 × 4 = 64

Key concepts demonstrated:
Arithmetic expansion with $(())

Exponentiation operator ** in shell arithmetic

Variable reference in arithmetic - direct names without $

Environment variables in mathematical operations

This script will work in your sandbox environment and correctly perform the exponentiation using the values from the BREATH and LOVE environment variables.
