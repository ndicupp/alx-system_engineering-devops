awk 'NR % 2'
Let me break this down:

awk is a powerful text processing tool

NR % 2 uses the modulo operator:

NR is the built-in variable that represents the current record (line) number

NR % 2 gives the remainder when the line number is divided by 2

When the result is 1 (true/odd line numbers), awk prints the line

When the result is 0 (false/even line numbers), awk doesn't print

Alternative solutions that also work:

bash
# Using sed
sed -n '1~2p'

# Using awk with explicit condition
awk 'NR % 2 == 1'
To create and test it:

bash
# Create the script
echo "awk 'NR % 2'" > 17-odd

# Make it executable
chmod +x 17-odd

# Test with the provided example
ls -1 | ./17-odd
The output should show every other line starting from the first line, which matches the example output:

text
bin
dev
home
lib
lib64
lost+found
mnt
proc
run
srv
t
t~
usr
vmlinuz
This solution is efficient and handles:

Any input from stdin

Printing odd-numbered lines (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.)

Working with any number of input lines

Being concise and readable
