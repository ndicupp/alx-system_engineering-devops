#!/bin/bash
printenv
First line: #!/bin/bash - Shebang specifying Bash interpreter

Second line: printenv - Command that prints all environment variables

How it works:
printenv is a command that displays all global/environment variables (covered in Package 3)

Environment variables are available to all child processes and shells

The output shows variables like HOME, PATH, USER, LANG, etc.

Each line shows a variable in NAME=value format

Alternative approach:
We could also use env which serves the same purpose:
#!/bin/bash
env
Key concepts demonstrated:
Environment variables vs local variables

Global variables available in all shells

Using built-in commands to inspect the shell environment

The script will work in your sandbox environment and display all environment variables including those specific to your Ubuntu 20.04 setup and the ALX sandbox configuration.
