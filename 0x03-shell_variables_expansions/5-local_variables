#!/bin/bash - Shebang specifying Bash interpreter
set - Command that displays all shell variables and functions


How it works:
The set command (covered in Package 3) displays:

Local variables (specific to current shell)

Environment variables (global variables)

Shell functions (defined functions)

Unlike printenv which only shows environment variables, set shows everything

The output includes variables like BASH, BASH_VERSION, functions, and both local and global variables

Key concepts demonstrated:
Local variables vs environment variables

Shell functions as part of the shell environment

Using set to inspect the complete shell environment

Difference between set and printenv/env

The script will work in your sandbox environment and display a comprehensive list of all variables and functions available in the current shell session, including those specific to Ubuntu 20.04 and the ALX sandbox configuration.
