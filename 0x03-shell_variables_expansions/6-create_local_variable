#!/bin/bash
BEST=School
#!/bin/bash - Shebang specifying Bash interpreter
BEST=School - Creates a local variable named BEST with value School

How it works:
This creates a local variable (covered in Package 3) that is only available in the current shell

No export command is used, so it remains local

The variable can be accessed with $BEST after sourcing the script

Local variables are not available to child processes

Usage:
julien@ubuntu:/tmp/0x03$ source ./6-create_local_variable
julien@ubuntu:/tmp/0x03$ echo $BEST
School

Key concepts demonstrated:
Local variable creation - Variables without export are local

Variable assignment syntax - NAME=value with no spaces around =

Local vs global variables - This variable won't be available in sub-shells

The script will work in your sandbox environment to create a local variable BEST with the value School that exists only in the current shell session.
