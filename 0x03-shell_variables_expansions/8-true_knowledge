#!/bin/bash
echo $((TRUEKNOWLEDGE + 128))

Key correction:
Removed the $ from inside the arithmetic expansion - In arithmetic expansion $(()), you can reference variables directly by name without the $ prefix.

Explanation:
First line: #!/bin/bash - Shebang specifying Bash interpreter

Second line: echo $((TRUEKNOWLEDGE + 128)) - Uses arithmetic expansion with direct variable reference

How it works:
In arithmetic expansion $(()), variables are referenced by name without $ (as covered in Package 2)

TRUEKNOWLEDGE is automatically expanded to its value within the arithmetic context

The expression TRUEKNOWLEDGE + 128 is evaluated

echo prints the result followed by a newline

Demonstration:

julien@production-503e7013:~$ export TRUEKNOWLEDGE=1209
julien@production-503e7013:~$ ./8-true_knowledge | cat -e
1337$
Key concepts:
Arithmetic expansion - $((expression))

Variable reference in arithmetic - Use variable names directly without $

Shell arithmetic - Integer operations

This should pass all checks:

✅ Exactly 2 lines

✅ First line: #!/bin/bash

✅ No &&, ||, ;, sed, or bc

✅ Correct output: 1337 when TRUEKNOWLEDGE=1209
